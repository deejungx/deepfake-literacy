In the 2020 local elections in India, the Bharatiya Janata Party Delhi president, Manoj Tiwari, was filmed making a campaign speech—in both English and a local Hindi dialect. Both looked and sounded convincingly real. In the video he goes on the attack, accusing the head of a rival party of having “cheated us.” But the version in the local dialect was a deepfake, a new kind of AI-enabled synthetic media. Produced by a political communications firm, it exposed the candidate to new, hard-to-reach constituencies. Lacking awareness of the discourse around fake media, many assumed it was real. The company behind the deepfake argued it was a “positive” use of the technology, but to any sober observer this incident heralded a perilous new age in political communication.
